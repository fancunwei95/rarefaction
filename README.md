# rarefaction

use finite difference method to solve rarefaction and shock waves with artificial viscosity in 1D.
rarefaction is the procedure that for a tube with fluid in it and the tube is closed on one side and there is a pistol on the other side then,
the pistol is drawn out so that the fluid has more avaiable space.
